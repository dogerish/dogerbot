Generates and sends a fractal tree with the given arguments. Usage: `fractal-tree [<options...>] [<color>] [<background color>] [<angle increment>] [<length increment>] [<number of branch splits>] [<resolution>] [<initial length>]`
Arguments:
	**color**: the color of the branches, as hex 0xRRGGBB (default purple (0x8000FF))
	**background color**: the color of the background, as hex 0xRRGGBB (default black)
	**angle increment**: the angle, in degrees, to add/subtract for each branch split (default is 30)
	**length increment**: the ratio of the length of the next branch to the length of the first branch (as a decimal) (default is 0.75)
		**example**: 0.75
			as a ratio, this is 3:4 - the next branch is 3/4 the length of the one it originated from/is attached to
	**number of branch splits**: the number of times for a branch to split into 2 more branches, or the depth of the recursion. (default is 15, max is 17)
	**resolution**: follows the syntax `WIDTHxHEIGHT`, where WIDTH is the starting width of the canvas and HEIGHT is the height. (default: 1000)
		**Alternate syntaxes**:
			**WIDTH or WIDTHx-**: if the angle increment, number of branch splits, and length increment are all default, this will make the final result have a width of WIDTH pixels. "-" can be replaced with any default indicator
			**-xHEIGHT**: same as above, but for height
			**-x-**: uses default
	**initial length**: The length (in pixels) of the initial/first branch / trunk of the tree. (default with both width and height specified is 200, but with only one or none specified, it is WIDTH over 4.8)
Since all these arguments are optional, if you don't want to specify one of them, just use a default indicator, aka a blank-representative thing (-, None, '', ' ', N/A, n/a, or /)

Example:
```
fractal-tree - 0x001000
```
