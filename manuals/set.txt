Sets channel or current channel to be used or not used by the bot for the command. Usage: `set [<options>...] <command> <bool> <server> <channel>`.
You must have the `Manage Channels` permission to use this command.
bool is the boolean value (1 or 0). 1 means that the channel will be used, 0 means that it won't be used. Special option -1 resets the entire server to its default state (all channels active)
By default, server and channel are the server and channel of the message. server must be the server ID of the server that has the channel, and channel must be a channel ID.
If nothing changes because the settings match, the bot will react with :ok_hand:. If the bot has enabled a channel, it will react with :white_check_mark:, otherwise it will react with :ballot_box_with_check:.
{options}
Example:
```
set cookie 1
```
