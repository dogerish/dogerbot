Report a bug. There is a 60 second cooldown after every use. Usage: `bugreport <issue>...`
All line breaks and attachments will be kept but any other formatting is lost, so don't worry too much about it.
Example:
```
bugreport Missing manual page for the help command!
Continuing to the next line also works.
```
