Arguments:
	**color**: the color of the branches, as hex 0xRRGGBB (default purple (0x8000FF))
	**background color**: the color of the background, as hex 0xRRGGBB (default black (0x0))
	**angle increment**: the angle, in degrees, to add/subtract for each branch split (default is 30)
	**length increment**: the ratio of the length of the next branch to the length of the first branch (as a decimal) (default is 0.75)
		**example**: 0.75
			as a ratio, this is 3:4 - the next branch is 3/4 the length of the one it originated from/is attached to
	**number of branch splits**: the number of times for a branch to split into 2 more branches, or the depth of the recursion. (default is 15, max is 16)
	**resolution**: follows the syntax `WIDTHxHEIGHT`, where WIDTH is the starting width of the canvas and HEIGHT is the height. (default is 1000, max is 2500x2500)
		**Alternate syntaxes**:
			**WIDTH or WIDTHx-**: if the angle increment, number of branch splits, and length increment are all default, this will make the final result have a width of WIDTH pixels. "-" can be replaced with any default indicator
			**-xHEIGHT**: same as above, but for height
			**-x-**: uses default
	**initial length**: The length (in pixels) of the initial/first branch / trunk of the tree. (default with both width and height specified is 200, but with only one or none specified, it is WIDTH over 4.8)
