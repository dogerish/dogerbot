# dogerbot - dogerish's Discord Bot
This is my discord bot, which uses the discord.js library in nodejs. The bot uses the fractal tree python script to generate fractal trees. Feedback is much appreciated!
# Log files
 The directory specified in config/config.json is where the log files can be found. Note that errors will only appear here if the bot is run with the **scripts/run** bash script. Otherwise it will appear on console output.
 The extension **.less** just means that it has cool color formatting, which normal text editors usually don't recognize. I recommend using `less -R file`, `more file`, or `cat file` to view them (these need to be executed in a terminal of course).
