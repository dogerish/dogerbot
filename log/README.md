# log files
This is where the log files can be found. Note that errors will only appear here if the bot is run with the <b>dogerbot</b> bash script. Otherwise it will appear on console output.
The extension <b>.less</b> just means that it has cool color formatting, which normal text editors don't recognize. I recommend using <b>less -r <file></b>, <b>more <file></b>, or <b>cat <file></b> to view them (these need to be executed in a terminal of course).
